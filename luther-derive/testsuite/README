All of the .rs files in this directory are intended to be stand alone
test files that can be complied (or not) by rustc. The test files
should rely on the extern crates luther and luther_derive, but not
any other crates. There is no expectation that the output of
running rustc on one of these .rs files will be run. The test is
running rustc itself.

The invocation of rustc will be something like:

    rusc -L dependency=... -extern luther=... --extern luther_derive=... file.rs

By convention compilation of files named succ*.rs are expected to succeed and 
compilation of files name fail*.rs are expected to fail.

The testsuite cargo alias will run the testsuite tool (in the tools/testsuite crate)
which will in turn run all of the tests. Invoke the alias as follows:

    cargo testsuite
